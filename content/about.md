## Who Am I?

I love to program, learn new technology's, and working on them. I also enjoy a variety of movies and books.

Currently working at Concur with their authentication/authorization team. I have about six plus years of working with backend systems, building REST APIs, working with cloud technologies, etc. in various environments and languages. In the future, I would like to work on scaling distributed systems. I am interested in trying out different languages and proficient to a varying degree in Clojure, Scala, Rust, Haskell, etc.
