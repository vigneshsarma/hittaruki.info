I have been a blogger(very  infrequent one) for a long time. One of the reasons for the infrequency is my own laziness. Along with that, the fact that I use a static blog generator and when I change my laptops or re-install the OS (which seems to be happening often) the whole environment required for static site needs to be re-installed doesn't help. In this I would have actually preferred a web based blogging platform. The freedom the a static blog generator provides in terms of options and verity is unbelievable.

The first static blog generator is ever encountered was Jekyll. My Initial Impressions for Jekyll are [here](). Even thought my laziness for not writing it not its fault, I still consider its initial setup to be too complex. Moving to octopress helped with the initial setup, but each time I came back to write my next blog, It seems to have changed a little bit.

This time once again, move to yet another platform [hugo](). You just need to download the binary and start. But again I spend a whole day setting up the theme to my liking. And replaced the existing site with it.

Now it feels like all I am writing about is the different blogging platforms and not writing anything else of interest. So I might as well tell you I have tried to use word-press and blogger as well.
