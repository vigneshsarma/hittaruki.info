I have been and infrequent blogger for a long time. One of the reasons for the infrequency is my own lazines. Along with that when I change my laptops or re-install the OS (which seems to be happening often) the whole environment required for static site needs to be re-installed. In this I would have actually priffered a web based blogging platform. The freedom the a static blog generator provides in terms of options and verity is unbelievalble.

The first static blog generator is ever encounterd was Jekeyll.

```clojure
(defn foo []
    (println "foo"))
```
